1. True or false: n^2 + n is O(n^2).
True because it will keep growing

2. True or false: n^2 * n is O(n^3).
True

3. True or false: n^2 + n is O(n).
False it would not be a fixed number

4. What’s the time complexity of the .indexOf array method?
O(n) - fixed number what ever is in indexOf

5. What’s the time complexity of the .includes array method?
O(n) - fixed number what ever is in the array

6. What’s the time complexity of the .forEach array method? 
O(n) - fixed number depending on the comparisons

7. What’s the time complexity of the .sort array method?
O(n log n) - It can rearrange what is in the array

8. What’s the time complexity of the .unshift array method?
O(n) - fixed number for whatever is added to the array

9. What’s the time complexity of the .push array method?
O(1) - not dependent on input size

10. What’s the time complexity of the .splice array method?
O(n) - based on a fixed number whatever is in the array and what we want to cut out or add in

11. What’s the time complexity of the .pop array method?
O(1) - can add to end
